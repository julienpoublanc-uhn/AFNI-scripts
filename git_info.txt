If you ever want to check your branches, you can run this command in your local repo to verify:
git branch -a
git branch -m master main	Rename local branch
git push -u origin main	Push new branch
git push origin --delete master	(Optional) Delete old master on GitHub

# To update my scripts
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push


Think of a repository like a folder for a full project.

Repository	What goes inside
AFNI-scripts	Bash or Python scripts specifically for AFNI workflows.
CVR-tools	Scripts (bash, python, whatever) related to Cerebrovascular Reactivity.
fMRI-analysis	Programs for general fMRI preprocessing or analysis.
GUI-tool	Your python graphical interface tool.

Term	Simple meaning
Repository (repo)	A folder/project with full history (e.g., fMRI-tools)
Branch	A parallel timeline/version of a repo (e.g., main, experiment-feature)
Commit	A save point or snapshot (e.g., "Fixed bug in script")
Push	Send your changes to GitHub
Pull	Get updates from GitHub to your computer
Clone	Make a full copy of a repo on your computer


Short Plan for You
One GitHub repo for each different kind of tool or project.
One branch main for each repo.
Update normally (add, commit, push) as you modify.
If you want, you can later learn about branching when you make bigger updates or experiments.
